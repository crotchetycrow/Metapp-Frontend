# Tourist guide web app

## A React.js frontend application

## Makers Graduates project

## Summary

The app in its current form will be designed as a tourist guide app, allowing users to find events and attractions near them whilst also looking for times and dates.

The app is comprised of two independent programs - a frontend react web app and a backend Python running with Flask.

Currently, the project is in the beginning stage of development and the team is working towards developing the MVP.

## Development Summary

The team is currently working on developing this tourist guide application. We are working throughout in an Agile manner, running one week sprints with weekly stand-ups and retros. We use a Trello board to manage our work and ensure we had visiual representation of our activities.

In the initial stages of the project we did a group brainstorm to identify ideas for the project and concluded we wanted to build a frontend React application which interacted with a Python backend. A common learning outcome for this project was to consolidate our learning from Makers and develop our portfolios.

We choose React for the frontend as we wanted to continue to learn JavaScript by working with a popular JavaScript framework.

We defined and completed out MVP by the third stand up of the project, following the principle of building the simplest features our project needed to function.

### MVP

As it stands, the MVP currently consists of these features:

- User's ability to use a search function to search for events
- Events are based in London only
- Events are listed with details and images, sorted by proximity and date
- Events are shown for the next 7 days from date of search
